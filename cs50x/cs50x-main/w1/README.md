# Problem Set 1

## What to Do
1. Log into code.cs50.io using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
2. Once your codespace has loaded, close any Welcome tabs that might have opened by default
3. In Codespace’s terminal, complete the steps under SSH at cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh to configure your codespace for some of CS50’s command-line tools. (You should skip this step if you have already set up your codespace for another CS50 course.)
4. Log into submit.cs50.io using your GitHub account and click Authorize to activate check50.
5. Run update50 in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click Rebuild now
6. Submit `Hello`
7. Submit one of:
   - this version of `Mario` if feeling less comfortable
   - this version of `Mario` if feeling more comfortable
8. Submit one of:
   - `Cash` if feeling less comfortable
   - `Credit` if feeling more comfortable
If you submit both versions of Mario, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

# Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors #

## Background ##
Rock, paper, scissors is a game for two players. Each player chooses one of three hand shapes: rock, paper, or scissors. The players show each other their hand shapes at the same time. Rock defeats scissors; scissors defeats paper; paper defeats rock. If both players select the same hand shape, the round ends in a tie.

## Instructions ##
Decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. The driver does the typing, while the navigator watches for errors and helps to plan ahead for the next steps. Drivers and navigators can switch roles as often as they would like throughout the pair programming session. Both driver and navigator should be focused on the programming task throughout the session.

Use Visual Studio Code to write a Python script called rps.py. At the top of the script, write a comment in which you list your full name and your partner’s full name.

In your script, ask the user to enter player 1’s hand shape ("r", "p", or "s") and player 2’s hand shape (same letters). Then determine the outcome of the round and print the appropriate string from the list below:

"Tie!"

"Player 1 wins!"

"Player 2 wins!"

Ask the user if they want to do another round (have them enter "y" for yes or "n" for no). Repeat the above steps until the user chooses not to do another round. When the user decides not to do another round, print "Goodbye!".

## Learning Outcomes ##
- Students will be able to describe the relationship between data types, classes, and objects
- Students will know what methods and attributes are and be able to recognize examples of each
- Students will understand the purpose of the `__init__()` method
- Students will understand what the `self` is and what it is used for
- Students will be able to write a class with attributes and methods, including `__init__()`
- Students will be able to create instances of a class, define and access attributes of instances, and invoke methods of instances

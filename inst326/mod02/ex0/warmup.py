Warm Up 1
What error message do you get when you run this program (hint: there are at least two problems)

def get energy(mass):
    speed_of_light = 300000000
    return mass * speed_of_light ** 2

weights = [1, 100, .5, .75]

while weights:
    joules = get_energy(kg)
    print(kg, "kg is equal to ", joules, "joules")

ANSWER RESPONSE:
- kg is not identified (should be identified as weights)
- while 'weights' does not fit the 'while' loop criteria
- speed_of_light variable is too big, causing memory error
- its required to input only one input while using 'get_energy formula'
and one input while printing.

What output do you see when you fix it?
ANSWER RESPONSE:
1 kg is equal to  9 joules
100 kg is equal to  900 joules
0.5 kg is equal to  4.5 joules
0.75 kg is equal to  6.75 joules

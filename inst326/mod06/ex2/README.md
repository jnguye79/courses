# Exercise 2: JSON and Twitter Data #

## Overview ##
Download the set of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s tweets in JSON format in [aoc.json](https://umd-ischool-inst326.github.io/inst326-public/modules/module06/exercises/aoc.json). 
Read the dataset into a Python object. Then, create a loop through the data, printing the text of each tweet.

## Tasks ##
- Try to write a program that will print just the hashtags (defined as any word beginning with "#") and links (defined as any word beginning with "http").
- What is the total number of tweets with **either** a hashtag or a link in them (NOTE: for the purpose of this assignment, a tweet containing both a link and a hashtag should only count once).

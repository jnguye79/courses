This module introduces the topic of "design patterns" in object-oriented programming with a look at two such patterns, Inheritance and Composition,
and how they can be implemented using Python classes.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, students should be able to:
- Use the inheritance pattern to share functionality among Python classes.
- Use method overriding to extend Python classes.
- Use the composition pattern to create classes that make up other classes.
- Build interfaces that provide access to component objects from the containing object.
- Understand the importance of careful consideration of use cases and reusability in designing software.

## Additional Readings
The Chapter "[Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Object_Oriented_Programming.html)" from the open-souce textbook, [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html) (University of Cape Town, 2013-2014) provides a good overview of this moduleâ€™s content.

For students interested in digging deeper into this topic the works of [Martin Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)) are a good next step.

i. First, create the two tables people_copy and enrollments_copy then insert all of
the data from their original tables. When creating the tables, preserve column
attributes and indexes (this can be done with the LIKE keyword)*/

CREATE TABLE people_copy 
	LIKE people;

following information (Insert a new student into people_copy table with these
values for each column) :
		person_id: The next automatically generated ID value
        lname: Smith
        fname: Ricky

need to investigate other tables to get the correct section_id values.

i. Turns out one of the original enrollments for Ricky was incorrect and we need to
change which section he is in. Keep the inserts the same but write an update that
switches Ricky from INST327 section 103 into INST327 section 102. Be sure not to
change any other values in enrollments_copy. */

i. The university has decided to cancel INST327 for the 2022 year, so next, you need to
remove all enrollments for the course for this Spring. First, write a query that replicates
the result set below, matching all data and format aspects, including column headers.

enrollments_copy table. Please order by section_id but any additional ordering is not

# Project 6: Data collection and sharing (statistics in sociology) (with an optional EXTRA-CREDIT part)

We can approximately define three types of feminism: (1) difference-denying, (2) difference-removing, (3) difference-honoring. Other approximate categorizations are possible. For the purposes of this project, we use this approximate categorization:

 

(1) Difference-denying feminism: In this approach, any difference between men and women is denied, and is said to be purely due to cultural impositions. There is no biological (called "essential") difference (no "on average" difference when doing group-wise comparison) between men and women. Every difference is socially constructed.

 

(2) Difference-removing feminism: There are biological difference between men and women, but these differences are burdens to women, like a curse of nature, and women must rely on technology to completely remove any biological difference between men and women to be "liberated" (for example only if we remove our wombs we can). Removing the difference is the only way of liberation. This type of feminism relies heavily on technology (especially biological technologies) for "liberation".

 

(3) Difference-honoring feminism: This approach does accept that there exist differences that are purely culturally-imposed and not "essential", but holds that in addition to those, there exist genuine essential differences, and denying or removing them harms women. Denying or harming differences harms everybody, not just women. Men and women have differences and they're both ok. What must change is the culture that values only masculine traits, and views feminine traits as unimportant and without value.

 

 

Find 10 respondents and ask them to read the above description (or read it to them yourself, whichever they choose), and then ask them these questions:

1) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 1 (difference-denying feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

2) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 2 (difference-removing feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

3) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 3 (difference-honoring feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree") what number would you pick?

4) Which of these three approaches do you think has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades ("most" in terms of magnitude, not quality, that is, we don't mean "best", just magnitude)?

 5) Are you or have been a mother?

 

Submit a csv file of your data, which must have 11 rows (header row for the column names, and 10 rows for 10 participants). The columns are:

1) answer to Q1

2) answer to Q2

3) answer to Q3

4) answer to Q4

5) answer to Q5

6) respondent's age

7) respondent's gender (optional)

8) respondent's occupation (stay-at-home person of any gender who takes care of family is considered as having an occupation in this project, and must be coded as "life-nurturer")

Survey ethics:

** Obtain informed consent: Clearly explain the survey's purpose and get voluntary consent.

** Ensure anonymity and confidentiality: Protect participants' privacy and anonymity in your submission.

** Avoid any pressure: if they don't like to start or continue the survey at any point, make sure to honor the request.

** Be honest: Be honest about the research purpose and avoid misleading participants.

** Maintain data integrity: Collect and report and upload data accurately and honestly.

 ** Respect: make sure to ask the questions politely and respectfully.

** Subjectivity: We only care about the participant's subjective opinion, they must be free to express it without any cues or pressures from the part of the interviewer (even quick facial expressions and interruptions).

 

 

 

Optional extra-credit part (3 additional points on top of the basic 5 points):

Then you can share your data publicly on the GitHub repository. Read this brief instruction manual Download this brief instruction manual(or you can easily search on the web). Upload your dataset on Github, and add a readme file and briefly explain what this dataset is.

 

On ELMS, submit your csv file, a the link to your GitHub repository.

(put the link in a text file, .docx or .txt, and zip that file along with the csv of results, and only upload one zip file that contains both of those files)
